Hey hey hey! It's shaboy Ray-z in the building! This is my first blog post, one of hopefully many more to come.

I made this blog with a few specific goals in mind. First, I wanted an outlet to showcase my professional development
to future employers. I'm probably going to populate this blog with a lot of technical stuff. Secondly, willing stuff
into existence just feels good. I felt a builder's high after creating this site and learned lots. Finally, I wanted
to improve my communication skills by becoming a better writer. Personally, I'm more awkward than I'd like in speaking.
I hope that churning out some well structured and thoughtful pieces of writing will make me a more articulate person in
general.

That was ~120 words. Aiming for at least 300 next post.
