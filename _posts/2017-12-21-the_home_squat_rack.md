You may be wondering what that new [lift log](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB_5VNW2kpkCRn-aH9lNBqQ) portion of my
site is. As of 12/21/2017, I've caught up to my 2015 goals to squat 6 plates and deadlift 8. My recently acquired home
gym helped.

**Pros of owning a home gym**:
* No excuse to skip a workout. If you slept at home, you could have lifted at home.
* Take as long as you like. I can chill watching TV while waiting for my next set.
* Consistent equipment. Commercial plates can vary by up to 5 pounds per plate.

**Cons**:
* Can't lower deadlifts quickly. I live on the second floor and the eccentric portion (lowering phase) of my deadlifts
turn into slow descending Romanian Deadlifts.
* Can't test 1 rep maxes. My squat stands don't have safeties. If I fail, I risk pissed off lower floor neighbors.

**The equipment** *(full disclosure, purchases through the amazon links will pay me commission)*:
1. [CAP Barbell, $130](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001K4OPY2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B001K4OPY2&linkCode=as2&tag=shaboyrayz-20&linkId=9c5116b403badaff9e8621674e1de480)
2. [245 lbs Rogue six shooter plate set, $530](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-6-shooter-olympic-plates)
3. [190 lbs Rogue add-on plates, 4x 45lbs, 2x 5lbs, ~$500 post tax w/ shipping & handling](https://www.roguefitness.com/rogue-6-shooter-olympic-plates)
4. [Titan Fitness Independent squat stands, $270](https://www.titan.fitness/2x3-upright-hd-squat-stand-deadlift-weight-rack.html)
5. [CAP Weight storage, $45](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VJP0TG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000VJP0TG&linkCode=as2&tag=shaboyrayz-20&linkId=85912985f879e691d903b4555f86c9e4)

**Total**: ~ $1475

**Did I save money on gym membership fees?** *No, I maintain an $85 monthly
[Active Sports Club Oakland membership](https://activesportsclubs.com/clubs/oakland-city-center/) solely to play indoor
basketball.*

**Could I have saved money on cheaper plates?** *Yes, I dabbled in cheap $1 per lb Golds Gym and Cap Barbell plates. However,
they had a chemical-ish odor and California Prop 65 warnings. I returned them. I splurged on Rogue plates because of their
precise weight, ease of handling, aesthetics, warranty, reputation for good customer's service, and lack of cancer-chemical
warnings.*

**Does it bother me that I can't fail on my lifts?** *No, the greatest power lifter of all time, Ed Coan, advocates rarely
lifting to failure. I leave 1-2 reps in the tank per set and intend to increase my lifts slowly over the years.*

Thanks for reading. The next milestone is to squat 8 plates and deadlift 10.
