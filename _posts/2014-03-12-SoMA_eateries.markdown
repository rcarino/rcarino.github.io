Here is an unordered list of my favorite lunch spots around work.

  * [Se√±or Sisig](http://www.yelp.com/biz/se%C3%B1or-sisig-san-francisco-3)
    + **+** My [people's food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillipines)
    + **+** California/Sisig burrito w/ egg == foodgasm. Better than chipotle.
    - **-** Long lines. I hustle here before they open at 11 and still wait 15 minutes.
    - **-** SoMA tax means your burrito costs ~ $10.
    - **-** Food truck, not available every day.
  * [Tava Indian Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tava-indian-kitchen-san-francisco-2)
    + **+** Usually get the chicken tikka burroti. Like it as much as chipotle.
    + **+** Short lines, even during lunch rush-hour.
    - **-** Slightly more as expensive than chipotle ~$8.
  * [OVO](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ovo-cafe-san-francisco)
    + **+** Flakey egg-tarts.
    + **+** Fried chicken bowl + fried rice + curry.
    + **+** Butter egg-tarts.
    + **+** Buy 4 egg tarts get $0.50 off.
    + **+** Buy 8 egg tarts get $1.00 off.
    + **+** Best egg tarts in SoMA.
    - **-** SoMA tax. Rice plate + egg tart costs ~$11.
    - **-** Only 3 stars on yelp is misleading. [fsck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck) the haters.
  * [Koja Kitchen](http://www.yelp.com/biz/koja-kitchen-berkeley-2)
    + **+** Beef koja. Best asian ricebowl in town. Not technically a ricebowl
    + **+** Tirasmisu confectionary thing is foodgasm, but ~$4
    - **-** Small portions. Takes 2 to fill me.
    - **-** SoMA tax. ~$6 per koja, ~$12 meal.
  * [Cafe Chaat](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-chaat-san-francisco-4)
    + **+** Chicken tikka plate.
    + **+** Favorite indian food in SoMA. I'd prefer over Tava every time if it were 1 block closer to work.
    - **-** SoMA tax. ~$12 for chicken tikka plate
  * [The Melt](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-melt-howard-san-francisco)
    + **+** Yummy grilled cheese
    - **-** Small portions
    - **-** Organic hipster tax. ~$8 for grilled cheese with meat
  * [Chipotle](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chipotle-mexican-grill-san-francisco-11)
    + **+** Good ole' chipotle needs no description
    + **+** Get away with not paying for double meat a good amount during lunch rush-hour.
  * [Ramen Underground](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-underground-san-francisco) *added to list on 3/27/14*
    + **+** decent portions, good ramen
    + **+** rice bowls are big and meaty... yuuum
    - **-** long lines during after work hours (5-7), ~ 20 minute waits
    - **-** NoMA/ Downtown SF tax prices meals at ~ $15. Who can refuse that $2 egg and $2 corn? Seriously, who?

I hope you enjoyed finding out about what sustains me. Surprisingly I'm not obese yet. 200lbs @ 5'11" at the time
of writing (flexes muscles). *GRRRRRRRRRRRR*

Food in SoMA tends to be pricier than what I'm used to, which is [berkeley asian ghetto food](http://www.yelp.com/biz/durant-square-asian-ghetto-berkeley).
Makes sense since rent is more expensive and the population density is comparatively higher. Also lines during lunch
rush-hour (Noon thru 1PM) tend to be ~15 minutes.

If I could design my own San Francisco, I'd make it more like Berkeley. I'd wave a magic stick and make half the people
go away. I wouldn't have to wait in lines. I'd also make every restaurant charge $3 less, to bring them in line with
berkeley prices. I'd also make my San Francisco's bay bridge cost $0, and kick out 3/4 of the cars so there's no traffic.
I'd also make the rent $1000 less per month, on average, so that I could afford to live in the city. My San Francisco
will be exponentially better than the current San Francisco.
