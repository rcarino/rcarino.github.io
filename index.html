            <h1>It's sha boy Ray-Z in the building!</h1>
            Raymond Arthur Carino (born 1990), known by his stage name Ray-Z, is a basketball phenom, weightlifter, and
            software artist. Ray-Z believes code is the essence of beauty. He adeptly blends
            minimalism, functional paradigms, and object oriented programming. The result is sheer elegance. Ray-Z's
            moniker is
            an homage to the rapper Jay-Z. Similar to how Jay pushed pills and counted bills, Ray pushes code and counts
            bills.

        <h1>Software Engineering Career</h1>

        <h2>2008-12: University</h2>

        <p>Mr Carino received his Bachelor's degree in computer science from UC Berkeley. He also tore up the basketball
            courts at the Recreational Sports Facility. Carino was initially a post-up player due to his towering height of 5'11.33"
            and imposing weight of 230lbs. He has since added a silky smooth jumper and aggressive dribble drive to his game
            after trimming his weight to 200lbs.
        </p>

        <h2>2012-14: First Job</h2>

        <p>Mr Carino worked the first 2 years of his career at a top media company. Prior to joining, the company's tech
            stack was a hodgepodge of acquired codebases with no cross-pollination between teams and projects.
            Mr Carino was instrumental in creating a modern content management system and front-end framework that
            bridged the code bases of several top traffic sites.</p>

        <h2>2014-present: Second Job</h2>

        <p>Mr Carino joined a pre IPO ad-tech company. The company has since IPO'd and is currently trading at more than
            twice its IPO price. Presumably, Mr Carino played at least a small part in this by shipping several high impact
            projects.
